In the United States, the episode aired on February 8, 2015 and lasted 50 minutes and 55 seconds, on AMC. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries.\nThe series mainly takes place in 2002, approximately six years prior to the title character Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) meeting Walter White (Bryan Cranston). In \"Uno\", Jimmy McGill (Saul), is a struggling lawyer working at the back of a nail salon. Jonathan Banks reprises his role as Mike Ehrmantraut, a retired cop working as a parking lot security guard, as does Raymond Cruz as Tuco Salamanca, a high-ranking Mexican drug dealer.

In his apartment that night, he tearfully watches a VHS tape of his old television commercials.\n\nMain story[edit]\nIn May 2002, Jimmy McGill is a struggling Albuquerque attorney. After representing three teenagers as a public defender, he is frustrated to be paid only $700. On his way out of the courthouse parking lot to meet a prospective client, Jimmy is stopped by parking attendant Mike Ehrmantraut. Mike refuses to let him exit until he pays cash or provides a court-supplied parking sticker.\nJimmy meets with Betsy and Craig Kettleman, who are being investigated for embezzlement. They are hesitant to hire him and when Jimmy later tries to order them flowers while driving, he hits a man on a skateboard. The skateboarder's twin brother videotapes the incident and threatens to call the police unless Jimmy pays them. Recognizing their ruse, Jimmy refuses. Afterward, he returns to his \"office\" \u2013 the boiler room of a Vietnamese beauty salon \u2013 where he finds a check from Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM). Jimmy tears up the check and later accuses the partners of offering a token payment to cheat his brother Chuck McGill out of his share of the law firm. On his way out of HHM's office, he sees the Kettlemans entering, which causes him to angrily and repeatedly kick a trash can.\nJimmy visits Chuck, who is housebound and believes he has electromagnetic hypersensitivity. He has no working lights or appliances and works by lantern on a manual typewriter. Chuck refuses to accept a buyout from HHM and also suggests that Jimmy stop using the McGill name for his law practice.\nJimmy tracks down the skateboarders, Cal and Lars, and tells them he got the nickname \"Slippin' Jimmy\" as a young man by faking \"slip and fall\" accidents for easy money. He arranges for one of them to be struck by Betsy's car, which will enable him to make another pitch to defend the Kettlemans. Instead of stopping to check on Cal after hitting him, the motorist drives off. Cal and Lars give chase, but when the car stops, an elderly woman exits. They try to make her pay and follow her into her house. Jimmy arrives moments later and begins to search, but is pulled into the house at gunpoint by Tuco Salamanca.\n\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nSeries co-creator Vince Gilligan, who also created predecessor Breaking Bad\nA spin-off series to Breaking Bad was first discussed during the airing of the show's fifth season.[2] In July 2012, Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan hinted at a possible spin-off series focusing on Goodman.[3] In April 2013, the series was confirmed to be in development by Gilligan and Gould; the latter wrote the Breaking Bad episode that introduced the character.[4] In a July 2012 interview, Gilligan said he liked \"the idea of a lawyer show in which the main lawyer will do anything it takes to stay out of a court of law\" including settling on the courthouse steps.[5]\n\nFilming[edit]\nThe show is filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Breaking Bad was also shot.[6] As filming began on June 2, 2014,[7] concerns were expressed regarding the possible disappointment from the series' turnout, in terms of audience reception.[8][9] On June 19, 2014, AMC announced it had renewed the series for a second season of 13 episodes to premiere in early 2016, with the first season to consist of 10 episodes, and that the series premiere had been delayed to early 2015.[10] The first teaser trailer debuted on AMC on August 10, 2014, and confirmed its premiere date of February 2015.[11]\nIn the opening scene of the episode, Saul (now hiding his real identity under the alias Gene), is working at a shopping mall Cinnabon. This scene is set in Omaha, Nebraska, but it was filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, at the Cottonwood Mall.[12] The scene is predominantly shown in black and white, except for a brief moment where a Saul Goodman commercial in color reflects on Gene's glasses.[13]\n\nCultural references[edit]\nAs Jimmy barges into a partner's meeting at HHM, he shouts \"You have meddled with the primal forces of nature, Mr. Hamlin, and I won't have it!", "start_char_idx": 3608, "end_char_idx": 7882, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8dc5f9d7-e672-4326-9edc-b10280c15e5e": {"__data__": {"id_": "8dc5f9d7-e672-4326-9edc-b10280c15e5e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6fe5ab57-46a2-4842-a595-c7bb6c5bcffd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "hash": "50ea1fee0aac0d37cebe9abffdf7029ec19e66da61500a0bba41e5263e092059", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "218770ea-e953-402e-87a3-8d73b3d2db8c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "hash": "f55967314fe375eda2a9dcf2cc504323c2c1da420f238a420f857060f9128daf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "58447637-8b09-4dc9-8ae3-a517da326858", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "149e6ad69682a3cc986145bf6098d7db61d1170ff495ee52909b7ada8eff28a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2f49739a781259deb4fb792f11a549db4e3a8b181393c0835a431c2eedef49b4", "text": "[10] The first teaser trailer debuted on AMC on August 10, 2014, and confirmed its premiere date of February 2015.[11]\nIn the opening scene of the episode, Saul (now hiding his real identity under the alias Gene), is working at a shopping mall Cinnabon.

For Christ's sake, guys.\"[14]\n\nReception[edit]\nCritical response[edit]\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 100% of 20 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.70/10. The website's consensus reads: \"The premiere will be familiar territory, but Bob Odenkirk's turn as Jimmy McGill establishes Better Call Saul as a worthy character study in its own right.\"[15]\n\nBob Odenkirk received universal acclaim for his performance in \"Uno\".\nErik Kain of Forbes said of the episode and series: \"[It] isn't just a spin-off of a popular TV show. So far, it's a terrific TV show on its own merits. It covers familiar ground, but it still manages to be its own unique snowflake.\"[16] Hank Stuever of The Washington Post graded it a \"B+\" and wrote the series \"is right in line with the tone and style of the original, now-classic series\" and that it \"raises more questions in two hours than it will readily answer\".[17] Stephen Marche of Esquire wrote that the first few episodes were better than Breaking Bad.[18] Kirsten Acuna of Business Insider declared the initial episodes \"everything you could possibly want from a spinoff television series\".[19]\nRoth Cornet of IGN gave the episode an 8.7 out of 10, saying \"Can Saul compete with Walter White? No. But he doesn't have to. Better Call Saul poses one simple, but fascinating question: What happened to Jimmy McGill that forced him to transform himself into the ruthless, hardened, yet entirely entertaining *criminal* lawyer Saul Goodman? The man that we came to know and love on Breaking Bad. I, for one, look forward to watching that story unfold.\"[20] Michael Star of The New York Post wrote, \"Sunday's premiere episode moves along at a brisk clip, with moody cinematography that, like Breaking Bad, somehow makes the bright New Mexico sunlight, set against a brilliant azure sky, seem like stormy foreboding\u2014lifted by Odenkirk's confident performance and Jimmy's snappy dialogue .... I'm always interested to see how/if a new show carries its premiere momentum forward, especially with a show like Better Call Saul, which was hyped so relentlessly by AMC that you began to wonder.\"[21]\nRobert Bianco of USA Today said \"Face it: When AMC announced it had ordered a prequel to Breaking Bad, odds are many of us saw it as a callow move by a network bereft of new ideas to milk an old one for all it was worth. Well, we were right\u2014but what we failed to factor in were the gifts star Bob Odenkirk and creators Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould would bring to Better Call Saul ... and their ability to transform what looked to be a sow's ear into something pretty much approaching a silk purse.\"[22] In her review, Mary McNamara of The Los Angeles Times summarized that \"the beauty of Saul was his unflappable nature; no matter how dire or dreadful the circumstances, he was able to identify the next logical step and take it. Jimmy McGill doesn't know how to do that yet; Better Call Saul will show us how he learned.\"[23]\n\nRatings and accolades[edit]\nUpon airing, the episode became the highest-rated series premiere for a scripted series in U.S. cable history up to that date, with 6.9 million viewers.[1] The show placed second for the night among U.S.", "start_char_idx": 7194, "end_char_idx": 11323, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58447637-8b09-4dc9-8ae3-a517da326858": {"__data__": {"id_": "58447637-8b09-4dc9-8ae3-a517da326858", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6fe5ab57-46a2-4842-a595-c7bb6c5bcffd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "hash": "50ea1fee0aac0d37cebe9abffdf7029ec19e66da61500a0bba41e5263e092059", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8dc5f9d7-e672-4326-9edc-b10280c15e5e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "hash": "2f49739a781259deb4fb792f11a549db4e3a8b181393c0835a431c2eedef49b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3266ea40-6e66-4bb9-af61-33b408475f82", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "29f0df2b31e3bb1d1f4c3b822b0efd940ae6a48e8f5a57e47ec1fb8e93e75d0d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "149e6ad69682a3cc986145bf6098d7db61d1170ff495ee52909b7ada8eff28a1", "text": "Well, we were right\u2014but what we failed to factor in were the gifts star Bob Odenkirk and creators Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould would bring to Better Call Saul ... and their ability to transform what looked to be a sow's ear into something pretty much approaching a silk purse.\"[22] In her review, Mary McNamara of The Los Angeles Times summarized that \"the beauty of Saul was his unflappable nature; no matter how dire or dreadful the circumstances, he was able to identify the next logical step and take it.

Written by series co-creator Peter Gould and directed by Michelle MacLaren, \"Mijo\" aired on AMC in the United States on February 9, 2015 and lasted 44 minutes and 20 seconds, one night after the series premiere. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries.\nThis episode marks the first appearance of Nacho Varga (played by Michael Mando).[1]\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nTuco Salamanca is preparing salsa when his grandmother returns after her run-in with the Lindholm brothers. Though they accidentally targeted the wrong driver, Cal and Lars follow her home and falsely claim serious injuries from the staged accident. They demand money and follow Tuco's grandmother into her house. Tuco uses her cane to beat them unconscious, then arranges for Nacho Varga, No Doze, and Gonzo to come with a van. Jimmy McGill arrives at the front door searching for Cal and Lars and Tuco drags him inside at gunpoint.\nJimmy insists Cal and Lars did not intentionally target Tuco's grandmother. Tuco allows Jimmy to see Cal and Lars, who are bound and gagged, but when Jimmy removes Lars' gag, Lars immediately implicates Jimmy.\nTuco and his men take Jimmy, Cal, and Lars to the desert and question Jimmy. Thinking quickly, Jimmy tells Tuco he is a lawyer, but Tuco does not believe him. Tuco threatens to cut off a finger and Jimmy falsely claims he is an FBI agent. Nacho is suspicious and threatens Jimmy again, so Jimmy goes back to admitting the truth\u2014he is a lawyer who intended to scam the Kettlemans.\nNacho convinces Tuco that killing a lawyer would attract unwanted attention. Tuco frees Jimmy but moves to kill Cal and Lars. Jimmy convinces Tuco to spare their lives and talks him into only breaking one leg each as punishment.\nAfter bringing Cal and Lars to a hospital, Jimmy arrives at a bar for a date.", "start_char_idx": 4, "end_char_idx": 4056, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9310aac-4de4-4c97-adb6-15f368a32b6c": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9310aac-4de4-4c97-adb6-15f368a32b6c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mijo_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3a84c20f-e3ac-44ba-a8d4-7be7185855cc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mijo_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "hash": "c5f74651016dadd9a263b37cde1bdb35da87d7880934338d9697447981afc1c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2170e6ef-2029-4fbb-b02e-9aa82cc212fe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mijo_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "hash": "c7b81e9dd10c80fcfcc99d771ef3abff7711e53f87a908dc77a00de4ed87aad7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "67609f6c-8961-4051-9690-54820dcac630", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd106285a714ca0879a39576dc500a991e28a6c5dbc805c4140b669f2acd9c22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e663e4ae2b641133fc9b759562f197b476562feb78619064820daf26971f18cd", "text": "Tuco allows Jimmy to see Cal and Lars, who are bound and gagged, but when Jimmy removes Lars' gag, Lars immediately implicates Jimmy.\nTuco and his men take Jimmy, Cal, and Lars to the desert and question Jimmy.

Tuco frees Jimmy but moves to kill Cal and Lars. Jimmy convinces Tuco to spare their lives and talks him into only breaking one leg each as punishment.\nAfter bringing Cal and Lars to a hospital, Jimmy arrives at a bar for a date. A customer's snapping breadsticks remind Jimmy of the broken legs, so he excuses himself and vomits in the bathroom. An intoxicated Jimmy later collapses on Chuck McGill's couch after forgetting to leave his cellular phone in Chuck's mailbox. Chuck\u2019s EHS causes him to throw the phone outside. The following morning, Chuck admits to seeing the hospital bill for Cal and Lars. Jimmy reassures Chuck that he is not returning to his conman past.\nJimmy returns to his office after several days in court. A salon employee tells him a client has arrived. The client is Nacho, who tells Jimmy he wants to steal the Kettlemans' $1.6 million, for which he will pay Jimmy a finder's fee. Jimmy insists he is a lawyer, not a criminal. Nacho writes his phone number on one of Jimmy's matchbooks and tells Jimmy to call when he figures out he is \"in the game.\"\n\nProduction[edit]\nThe episode was written by series co-creator and executive producer Peter Gould, who originally wrote the episode that introduced Saul Goodman in the second season of Breaking Bad. It was directed by Michelle MacLaren, the most prolific director for Breaking Bad, directing 11 episodes and also served as an executive producer.[2][3]\n\nCultural references[edit]\nDuring the episode, there is a montage in which Jimmy's routine is revealed: Grabbing his coffee, defending clients, collecting his check, and his ongoing battle with the parking attendant, Mike.\nDuring his routine he always looks in the mirror as he states,  \u201cIt\u2019s showtime, folks!\u201d a line from Bob Fosse's All That Jazz. All That Jazz is about a director and choreographer trying to balance out his work and personal life. The use of the particular line \u201cIt\u2019s showtime, folks!\u201d emphasizes the concept that Jimmy views this as a performance.[4]\n\nReception[edit]\nUpon moving to its regular Monday slot, the episode received 3.4 million viewers and a 1.6 rating among adults 18\u201349 in the United States.[5] This equated to a 50 percent drop in viewers, along with a 52 percent decline in the demographic.[6]\nErik Kain of Forbes said that despite hating the long and drawn-out restaurant scene, the overall episode was good. Despite this he felt that he wasn't \"sitting nearly as close to the edge of my seat [as in Breaking Bad]\u2014but it's entertaining and funny and still beautifully shot, acted, and written.\"[7] David Segal of The New York Times, in a positive review, noted that his favourite part of the episode \"is the elaborate, jaunty montage of Jimmy at court, which pays tribute to the elaborate, jaunty montage in Bob Fosse's All That Jazz, complete with the same Vivaldi concerto and \"It's showtime!\" catchphrase.[8]\nCatherine Gee of The Telegraph gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars, saying:\n\nWe got to see Jimmy McGill... truly show off his negotiating skills when haggling over the twins' fate. And it is in the deft hands of the episode\u2019s writer and co-creator Peter Gould that we got to indulge in a light chuckle over whether McGill can talk Tuco down from a flaying to a leg-breaking while avoiding the possible detours of eye-gouging and tongue-ripping.[9]\nRoth Cornet of IGN gave the episode a 9 out of 10, saying \"Better Call Saul hit the ground running with its second episode; setting the stage for a series that is part morality play, part Greek tragedy (replete with a foregone and less than savory conclusion) and part love letter to great performers\u2014whatever walk of life they happen to be on.\"[10] Richard Vine of The Guardian was also positive in his view.", "start_char_idx": 3236, "end_char_idx": 7564, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67609f6c-8961-4051-9690-54820dcac630": {"__data__": {"id_": "67609f6c-8961-4051-9690-54820dcac630", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mijo_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3a84c20f-e3ac-44ba-a8d4-7be7185855cc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mijo_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "hash": "c5f74651016dadd9a263b37cde1bdb35da87d7880934338d9697447981afc1c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9310aac-4de4-4c97-adb6-15f368a32b6c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mijo_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "hash": "e663e4ae2b641133fc9b759562f197b476562feb78619064820daf26971f18cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8dc88a4e-0f8f-485c-82b6-4f84ba59e8e8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "61e7fbc024fa1c01336c4c282984211ca1d257f6bad9d2f3362379dadef0871f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "cd106285a714ca0879a39576dc500a991e28a6c5dbc805c4140b669f2acd9c22", "text": "And it is in the deft hands of the episode\u2019s writer and co-creator Peter Gould that we got to indulge in a light chuckle over whether McGill can talk Tuco down from a flaying to a leg-breaking while avoiding the possible detours of eye-gouging and tongue-ripping.[9]\nRoth Cornet of IGN gave the episode a 9 out of 10, saying \"Better Call Saul hit the ground running with its second episode; setting the stage for a series that is part morality play, part Greek tragedy (replete with a foregone and less than savory conclusion) and part love letter to great performers\u2014whatever walk of life they happen to be on.\"[10] Richard Vine of The Guardian was also positive in his view. In particular he felt that \"The best thing to come out of the desert is our introduction to Nacho Varga. Tuco's far more reasonable associate has sized up the situation and tracked Jimmy down to his \"office\"\".[11] The Atlantic named \"Mijo\" one of the best television episodes of 2015.[12]\nMichael Star of the New York Post gave the episode a 3 out of 4 rating, saying:\n\nSunday's premiere episode moves along at a brisk clip, with moody cinematography that, like Breaking Bad, somehow makes the bright New Mexico sunlight, set against a brilliant azure sky, seem like stormy foreboding\u2014lifted by Odenkirk's confident performance and Jimmy's snappy dialogue [...]. I'm always interested to see how/if a new show carries its premiere momentum forward, especially with a show like Better Call Saul, which was hyped so relentlessly by AMC that you began to wonder. But Monday night's second episode does a nice job of maintaining its mojo, as Jimmy has an epiphany that will change the course of his life, and we're in for several more surprises. It's a good start for a series that's already been renewed for a second season\u2014and will have time to grow.[13]\nReferences[edit]", "start_char_idx": 6888, "end_char_idx": 8734, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8dc88a4e-0f8f-485c-82b6-4f84ba59e8e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "8dc88a4e-0f8f-485c-82b6-4f84ba59e8e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mijo_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3a84c20f-e3ac-44ba-a8d4-7be7185855cc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mijo_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "hash": "c5f74651016dadd9a263b37cde1bdb35da87d7880934338d9697447981afc1c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "67609f6c-8961-4051-9690-54820dcac630", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mijo_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "hash": "cd106285a714ca0879a39576dc500a991e28a6c5dbc805c4140b669f2acd9c22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "364b9b7d-da2a-4e5b-9142-b82821b3e6ab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0eb3664b9bc9a2392cc4cca2bbde77cb28061ecd68f257079e26828540a3082c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "61e7fbc024fa1c01336c4c282984211ca1d257f6bad9d2f3362379dadef0871f", "text": "I'm always interested to see how/if a new show carries its premiere momentum forward, especially with a show like Better Call Saul, which was hyped so relentlessly by AMC that you began to wonder.

The episode aired on February 16, 2015 and lasted 45 minutes and 12 seconds, on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nOpening[edit]\nIn a flashback to 1992, Chuck McGill meets Jimmy McGill in the Cook County Jail, where Jimmy is incarcerated for an offense that could result in him having to register as a sex offender. Jimmy pleads with Chuck to help get the charges dismissed. Chuck agrees to represent Jimmy on the condition that he stop running cons and find legitimate employment.\n\nMain story[edit]\nIn the present, Jimmy is anxious about Nacho Varga's plot to steal from the Kettlemans.[a] He calls Kim Wexler, a friend at HHM, who represent the Kettlemans. Jimmy indirectly warns Kim about the potential danger but then breaks off the call, insisting he is \"no hero\". Later that night, Jimmy calls the Kettlemans anonymously and warns them. The Kettlemans look outside and see somebody surveilling them from a parked van.\nThe next morning, Kim tells Jimmy that something has happened to the Kettlemans. He rushes to their house to find it surrounded by police, and finds out the entire Kettleman family is missing. Believing Nacho has kidnapped them, Jimmy tries unsuccessfully to reach him by phone. Jimmy is picked up by the police, who tell him they have arrested Nacho and that he has requested Jimmy as his lawyer.\nAt the police station, Nacho admits to Jimmy that he surveilled the Kettlemans but denies kidnapping them. Nacho warns Jimmy that if he does not get the charges dropped, Nacho will have him killed. Jimmy is unsuccessful at persuading the police to release Nacho but convinces Kim to take him to the Kettleman house so he can investigate. Jimmy notices some inconsistencies, such as a missing child's doll, and theorizes that the Kettlemans staged their kidnapping. Jimmy tells Kim he warned the Kettlemans about Nacho, which probably drove them into hiding.\nAt the courthouse, Jimmy starts a fight with Mike Ehrmantraut, who subdues him. The police ask Mike to press assault charges so they can leverage Jimmy to testify against Nacho, which Mike initially agrees to do but later changes his mind once he hears Jimmy's idea of what happened to the Kettlemans. He suggests to Jimmy that Jimmy's theory about the Kettlemans' disappearance is correct. Mike then recounts a similar case he investigated as a Philadelphia police officer and tells Jimmy the Kettlemans are probably hiding somewhere close to home. With the new lead, Jimmy explores the desert near the Kettleman house and finds their campsite. He confronts the Kettlemans, gets into a struggle with them, and inadvertently discovers their stolen money.\n\nProduction[edit]\nThe episode was written by co-executive producer Thomas Schnauz, who was also a writer and producer on Breaking Bad.[1][2] It was directed by Terry McDonough, who directed episodes for Breaking Bad, including the episode that introduced Saul Goodman.[3]\n\nReception[edit]\nUpon airing, the episode received 3.23 million American viewers, and an 18-49 rating of 1.6.[4]\nErik Kain of Forbes said that \"Overall, this was yet another strong entry in the show. Great shots of New Mexico, plenty of humor, and a little bit of mystery all kept this one humming from start to finish.\"[5]\nMichael Hogan of The Telegraph gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars, concluding:\n\nBetter Call Saul has hit the ground running and already become one of the best shows on TV\u00a0\u2013 even if it\u2019s not on TV in the traditional sense. A worthy prequel to Breaking Bad. Perhaps lightning can strike twice in the same place after all.[6]\nRoth Cornet of IGN gave the episode 8.5 out of 10, saying \"Better Call Saul continues to settle into itself, as Jimmy McGill's will to do the right thing is tested.\"[7]\" Richard Vine of The Guardian also gave a positive review, and was pleased that the episode began to examine Jimmy's relationships with Chuck and Kim, who \"you really get the sense that she's fond of him, against her better judgement\".[8]\nThe episode earned a 100% \"fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, out of 20 reviews.[9]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ As seen in \"Mijo\".\n\n\nReferences[edit]", "start_char_idx": 2018, "end_char_idx": 6431, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05c6e2ad-eb18-4f39-8f19-5ae195e46a63": {"__data__": {"id_": "05c6e2ad-eb18-4f39-8f19-5ae195e46a63", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacho_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c4bb0d7d-6c9c-4209-8a7e-585bd7ae5679", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacho_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "hash": "77b05bfb019030a55bb69de8cd969e34d68ee04d6fb96b62577723fec27d8cc5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4a78eb76-0895-4849-a873-4502f1e3547b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacho_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "hash": "8451f4ca5dc21a7a2bb0f47cfd5d1831d587c8d98d0257c14e687f412ce28cef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "459f5049-892f-4c41-8c5f-f75382dd49c7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f240f05cb7f09942a0526f2cb3ca4dc5d6abc0a58fb354ca4e1d9299205c7aee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b445796edeb7d694ec4e60c147e74aaa16576087d6739b2186fbb0c2775c8fca", "text": "^ As seen in \"Mijo\".\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Littleton, Cynthia (December 20, 2013). \"'Breaking Bad' Writers Join 'Better Call Saul' Staff\".

The episode aired on February 23, 2015, on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on the streaming service Netflix in several countries.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nIn a flashback to 1992, Jimmy McGill and his new friend Stevie leave a bar and Jimmy jokes that his name is Saul Goodman.[a] In an alley, they discover a barely conscious drunk man next to a wallet full of cash. Stevie takes the cash and Jimmy takes the man's Rolex watch. Jimmy estimates the Rolex to be worth more than the wallet, leading Stevie to trade the found money plus additional cash of his own for the watch. After Stevie runs away with the watch, a cheap counterfeit, Jimmy and the \"unconscious\" man, his partner Marco Pasternak, return to Jimmy's residence to split the proceeds of their scam.\nIn the present, Jimmy gives the Kettlemans the option of hiring him. Instead, they offer a bribe if he does not reveal they are in possession of the stolen $1.6 million,[b] and he accepts. Nacho Varga is released from custody and accuses Jimmy of warning the Kettlemans. Jimmy says he warned the family for the sake of their children, and that Nacho should be grateful the warning prevented him from committing kidnapping or murder, because he was noticed while surveilling the Kettlemans.\nJimmy enters the money from the Kettlemans in his accounts as a retainer so it appears to be a legitimate payment. He spends the money on a personal makeover that imitates Howard Hamlin\u2019s appearance and a billboard advertisement that shares obvious similarities with Hamlin Hamlin & McGill. Kim Wexler confronts Jimmy, and Howard sues him for trademark infringement. The court rules for HHM and Jimmy is ordered to remove the billboard.\nAfter failing to persuade news outlets to cover his predicament as a human interest story, Jimmy hires a freelance media team to record his video plea for sympathy. During filming, the worker removing the billboard falls and is held up only by his safety harness. Jimmy climbs up and pulls the worker to safety while passersby watch and record, as does his media team. Howard and Kim realize Jimmy staged the rescue for publicity.\nThe next day, Jimmy brings Chuck McGill's daily newspapers, but hides the local one that includes a report on the rescue. Chuck becomes suspicious when he notices the missing paper, so he braves exposure to electricity to run to his neighbor's driveway and steal theirs, leaving a $5 bill as payment.\n\nProduction[edit]\nThe episode was written by supervising producer Gennifer Hutchison, who was also a writer and producer on Breaking Bad.[1][2] It was directed by Colin Bucksey, who directed four episodes of Breaking Bad.[3] This is the first episode chronologically in which the name Saul Goodman is used.[4]\n\nReception[edit]\nUpon airing, the episode received 2.87 million American viewers, and an 18-49 rating of 1.4.[5]\nThe episode received a positive reception from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, based on 22 reviews, it received a 95% approval rating with an average score of 8.19 out of 10. The site's consensus reads, \"'Hero' marks the essential early evolution of Saul's conning skills, beginning his amusing transformation into the well-known Breaking Bad personality.\"[6]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ A play on the phrase \"it's all good, man\"\n\n^ As seen in \"Nacho\"\n\n\nReferences[edit]", "start_char_idx": 1920, "end_char_idx": 5476, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df9bb68b-774f-4029-b387-15542642fdbd": {"__data__": {"id_": "df9bb68b-774f-4029-b387-15542642fdbd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a003c8d7-0ae5-496b-b398-60fcdd622d27", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "hash": "7de9d0697b844245ba6480ab594a35bdfb85ab9ff0ba8e000ad48a987dfabaa9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1e4ad985-dd0f-4631-8928-5e0bc477f81a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "hash": "7a4bc13f67e9164328528ab5eb910b0a48a192c1316804de05c8818c501f1bde", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e03ed91d-23eb-4c47-89aa-6f6443d81430", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "912b08b3c78493fb079093bc21d90980ba91e74a0515a9f792ceb662010559f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "40c53932a0b1e5cb000745c25a2be8c08a11220ad8fa43aa2e4f53b48a5a0502", "text": "^ A play on the phrase \"it's all good, man\"\n\n^ As seen in \"Nacho\"\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Littleton, Cynthia (December 20, 2013). \"'Breaking Bad' Writers Join 'Better Call Saul' Staff\".

The episode aired on March 2, 2015, on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on the streaming service Netflix in several countries.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nPolice arrive at Chuck McGill's house after his neighbor reports the stolen newspaper.[a] Chuck's living conditions cause the officers to believe he is producing methamphetamine, so they kick in his door and tase him.\nThe publicity from Jimmy McGill's billboard rescue results in several new prospective clients, most of whom are not viable because of their eccentricities. After a fruitless day, Jimmy visits Mrs. Strauss, an elderly woman who collects Hummel figurines, one of which is a rare and valuable Alpine Shepherd Boy. He assists her with estate planning, which consists mostly of allocating her Hummels to friends and relatives. Mrs. Strauss finds Jimmy's personality charming. He offers to take half his fee in advance and half after her will is completed, but she pays the full amount up front in cash.\nThat evening, Kim Wexler suggests Jimmy's success with his older clients might lend itself to a career in elder law. Jimmy considers it, but is interrupted when Kim takes a call from Howard Hamlin. After hanging up, she tells Jimmy that Chuck has been hospitalized.\nA doctor proves Chuck's electromagnetic hypersensitivity is psychosomatic by turning on his hospital bed's control panel without him noticing. She recommends Chuck be committed to a mental institution, but Chuck wants to go home and Jimmy supports his decision. Howard then arrives and Jimmy concludes that Howard does not want Chuck committed because Jimmy would obtain guardianship and negotiate for Chuck to receive the full value of his partnership in a buyout. Jimmy then threatens to have Chuck committed, but tells Kim he said it only to scare Howard. Jimmy brings Chuck home and discovers Chuck has learned of his billboard rescue. Jimmy promises a skeptical Chuck he will follow the rules in the future.\nAfter mimicking Andy Griffith's clothing and mannerisms from the TV series Matlock, Jimmy promotes his new elder law specialty at a nursing home. Exiting the courthouse parking lot, Jimmy gives Mike Ehrmantraut a business card with his new \"Need a Will? Call McGill!\" slogan printed on it.\nMike is parked outside a woman's house. She comes out, gets in her car, and stares at Mike uncomfortably for several moments before they drive away in opposite directions. Mike is later visited at home by several police officers, one of whom he recognizes from his own tenure as an officer in Philadelphia.\n\nProduction[edit]\n\"Alpine Shepherd Boy\" is the first Better Call Saul episode not to be written or directed by someone who wrote or directed for Breaking Bad. It was directed by Nicole Kassell and written by Bradley Paul.[1] The episode was originally titled \"Jello\", referring to the advertisements Jimmy had for his law practice on the bottom of the Jello lids that were given to the elderly.[2] The showrunners intended each episode title to end in the letter \"o\" but were unable to obtain permission to use the trademarked gelatin brand name \"Jell-O\".[3][4][5]\n\nReception[edit]\nUpon airing, the episode received 2.71 million American viewers, and an 18-49 rating of 1.2.[6]\nThe episode received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, based on 20 reviews, it received a 95% approval rating with an average score of 6.80 out of 10. The site's consensus reads, \"With 'Alpine Shepherd Boy', Better Call Saul continues to forge its own identity while establishing its characters and their journeys in surprising ways.[7] IGN gave the episode a 9.0 rating.[8] The Telegraph rated the episode 4 out of 5 stars.[9]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ As seen in \"Hero\".\n\n\nReferences[edit]", "start_char_idx": 1887, "end_char_idx": 5850, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e7b4172-890d-48e6-aa03-a1a4263e0143": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e7b4172-890d-48e6-aa03-a1a4263e0143", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_Shepherd_Boy"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ba6c39a4-f15e-4a06-9e1e-3c44921ffba2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_Shepherd_Boy"}, "hash": "bb35ee24cdbe8c89808df839e54fea793a8f63ceef6541342e1ac2ac4d469cca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "da2c14b6-9820-4025-a292-901240b81fe1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_Shepherd_Boy"}, "hash": "7ad5e03c613ac0c60d736477339bdefa9132659c6dc41af68e375af317c72a82", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "29ccecaf-85c9-4fd5-89c6-0fc440701413", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d2a6a694cbed593d03dbbc7c7a0579a618f775cbbbabd6b437981d2aa78d4102", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e126f099dd82612ecf87f7650b2d3c914dc4724108c969dadc283da36a54a4f7", "text": "^ As seen in \"Hero\".\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Kondolojy, Amanda (June 19, 2014). \"'Better Call Saul' Renewed for Second Season by AMC; First Season Pushed Back to 2015\".

The episode aired on March 9, 2015, on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on the streaming service Netflix in several countries.\nThe episode received acclaim from critics, with Jonathan Banks's performance being singled out for praise.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nOpening[edit]\nIn a flashback, Mike Ehrmantraut leaves a train in Albuquerque and re-bandages his wounded left shoulder, then meets his daughter-in-law Stacey[a] and granddaughter Kaylee. Stacey and Mike briefly discuss the death of Matt, Mike's son and Stacey's husband. Afterward, Mike's wounded shoulder is treated by Dr. Caldera, an Albuquerque veterinarian.\n\nMain story[edit]\nPhiladelphia detectives Sanders and Abbasi[b] attempt to question Mike, who requests that Jimmy McGill represent him. The detectives are investigating the death of Mike's son Matt, a police officer who was killed in a 2001 ambush. Matt's partners, Troy Hoffman and Jack Fensky were killed in a similar ambush six months later and the detectives suspect Mike. Jimmy intentionally spills his coffee and Mike pretends to help Abbasi clean his jacket while stealing Abbasi's notebook.\nMike discovers from Abbasi's notes that Stacey contacted Philadelphia police after she discovered money Matt previously hid in the lining of a suitcase, hoping that investigating the source of the cash would help identify Matt's killer. In a flashback to Philadelphia, Mike breaks into a police car outside a bar. He then enters the bar and drunkenly hints to Fensky and Hoffman he knows something they did. At closing time Mike announces he plans to move to Albuquerque. As he staggers home, Fensky and Hoffman offer him a ride and help him into the back seat.\nMike tells Fensky and Hoffman he knows they killed Matt. Fensky and Hoffman plan to kill Mike but Mike is not actually drunk. Mike shoots Fensky using the revolver he had hidden in the back seat when he broke into the car earlier. Hoffman attempts to draw his service pistol, but Mike kills him. Fensky wounds Mike in the left shoulder, and Mike shoots Fensky in the throat. Mike kills Fensky with a shot to the head, then walks away and prepares to depart for Albuquerque.\nIn Albuquerque, Mike admits to Stacey that corruption was rampant in Matt's precinct and included Mike. When Hoffman offered to include Matt, Matt asked for Mike's advice. Mike suggested not taking the bribes would mark him as a whistleblower, so he should accept. Hoffman and Fensky murdered him because his hesitation made them fear he would turn them in. Stacey asks who killed Hoffman and Fensky. Mike says now she knows what happened and asks if she can live with it.\n\nProduction[edit]\nThe script was the first-ever television script written by Gordon Smith, who was previously a writer's assistant on Breaking Bad.[1][2] It was directed by Adam Bernstein, who directed several episodes of Breaking Bad.[3]\n\nReception[edit]\nJonathan Banks received critical acclaim for his performance in the episode, which earned him a Primetime Emmy Award nomination.\nUpon airing, the episode received 2.57 million American viewers, and an 18\u201349 rating of 1.3.[4]\nThe episode received near universal acclaim, with unanimous praise for Jonathan Banks's performance, which some critics considered award-worthy. On Rotten Tomatoes, based on 25 reviews, it received a 100% approval rating with an average score of 8.80 out of 10. The site's consensus reads, \"In a departure from the existing Better Call Saul narrative, 'Five-O' provides essential backstory for Mike's character, delivered in a gripping, award-worthy performance by Jonathan Banks.\"[5]\nRoth Cornet of IGN gave it a score of 9.7 out of 10, praising the performance of Jonathan Banks, the episode's pacing and interwoven storylines, as well as the final scene of the episode. She concluded, \"Better Call Saul continues to deliver some of the best of what television has to offer as both those familiar with Breaking Bad and new viewers alike were given a shattering look at Mike's tragic past.\"[6] Tim Surette of TV.com also highly praised the performance of Banks, and wrote it is worthy of an Emmy, calling it \"one of the best episodes to date of 2015's best new show to date\".[7]\n\"Five-O\" received three Primetime Emmy Award nominations. Jonathan Banks was nominated for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, Gordon Smith was nominated for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series, and Kelley Dixon was nominated for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series.[8] When Peter Dinklage won for Outstanding Supporting Actor, he praised the other nominees, and singled out Banks by name.[9]\n\nNotes[edit]", "start_char_idx": 1905, "end_char_idx": 6796, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e866582a-2d86-44ba-a497-b153cb3b8ea2": {"__data__": {"id_": "e866582a-2d86-44ba-a497-b153cb3b8ea2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-O_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "152404bb-1095-4c05-ac63-da45a35cd84a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-O_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "hash": "9b94faf52028e2173946ccd3075a5b332f038279a6c40fee8d17ced262a7e1a3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b4bf8465-551e-4e28-8ef9-1391321f7763", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-O_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "hash": "ff837711f936d35995c10fe8422d9939c1112cbf3a97c677b0e68669c66dab2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a81d5e02-f144-4f5b-895a-a68f203c2a84", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7d043a911e7458a8af83a0c6062bc161e8985a20eb19159b7c0373dba438521c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "cab3585383443cc16254983c2c3980ee0926f8a81b1c0e702ba7fd9f1083288b", "text": "^ The woman Mike sees leave her house in \"Alpine Shepherd Boy\".\n\n^ Who met Mike at his house at the end of \"Alpine Shepherd Boy\".\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Friedman, Megan (March 11, 2015). \"Behind Mike's Gut-Wrenching Backstory on Better Call Saul\".

The episode aired on March 16, 2015 on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nJimmy McGill and Mike Ehrmantraut return Abbasi's notebook,[a] claiming they found it in the police station parking lot. Despite Abbasi's accusations, Sanders privately assures Mike he has little to fear. Jimmy finds Chuck McGill standing outside his home, claiming to be building up a tolerance to electromagnetism. He stores his case files at Chuck's house, secretly hoping to rekindle Chuck's enthusiasm for the law. He later brings Kim Wexler to an office suite he is considering renting and asks her to be his partner. She turns him down because of her loyalty to HHM.\nKim meets with Betsy and Craig Kettleman and proposes a plea deal that includes the return of the embezzled $1.6 million and 16 months in prison for Craig. Since losing a trial would mean 30 years in prison, she recommends Craig accept. Betsy refuses, maintaining Craig's innocence and denying there is any money to return. The Kettlemans fire Kim and hire Jimmy, who initially urges them to accept the plea bargain. Betsy blackmails Jimmy by pointing out that the \"retainer\" the Kettlemans paid him[b] implicates him in their crime. While picking up records from HHM, Jimmy discovers Kim has been demoted as a result of losing the Kettlemans as clients.\nJimmy enlists Mike's help, and Mike sprays a fluorescent liquid on cash taken from Jimmy's bribe, which he plants outside the Kettleman house. The Kettlemans find it, assume it came from the embezzled money, and add it to the rest of the cash in their hiding place. Mike breaks in and uses a blacklight to trace the money to a false bottom in a bathroom cabinet. He leaves with the cash, and Jimmy has him deliver it to the district attorney. Mike tells Jimmy that completing this task satisfies the debt he owes for Jimmy's aid in stealing Abbasi's notebook.\nThe next day, Jimmy visits the Kettlemans. When they discover the money missing, Betsy again threatens to reveal that Jimmy is also guilty. Jimmy replies that if she does, she will be guilty of a crime for bribing him. If Betsy and Craig are both convicted, the Kettleman children will grow up without parents. The Kettlemans agree to accept Kim's plea deal, deciding that only one parent going to prison is their best option. Knowing he is now unable to afford a new workspace, a frustrated Jimmy returns to his prospective office to vent his anger.\n\nProduction[edit]\nThis was the second episode written by supervising producer Gennifer Hutchison for the series. It was directed by Larysa Kondracki.\n\nReception[edit]\nUpon airing, the episode received 2.67 million American viewers, and an 18\u201349 rating of 1.3.[1]\nThe episode received a generally positive reception from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, based on 24 reviews, it received a 92% approval rating with an average score of 7.69 out of 10. The site's consensus reads, \"A more low-key episode than the heart-wrenching one that came before, \"Bingo\" feels like a turning point in Jimmy's ongoing quest to be a better person.\"[2] IGN gave the episode an 8.8 rating.[3] The Telegraph rated the episode 4 out of 5 stars.[4]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ As seen in \"Five-O\".\n\n^ During \"Hero\".\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Bibel, Sara (March 17, 2015). \"Monday Cable Ratings: 'WWE Raw' Wins Night, 'Better Call Saul', 'Bates Motel', 'Love & Hip Hop', 'The Fosters' & More\".

The episode aired on March 23, 2015 on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries. It is named after the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nOpening[edit]\nIn a flashback, Jimmy McGill is working in the mail room at Hamlin Hamlin McGill when he receives notice that he has passed the state bar exam. He tells Chuck, hoping to be hired as an attorney, but Chuck seems unenthusiastic. Later, Howard Hamlin tells Jimmy the firm will not hire him, but he promises to re-examine his application in six months.\n\nMain story[edit]\nJimmy is suspicious when a client mentions that her nursing home, Sandpiper Crossing, controls her pension and Social Security payments while only providing her a monthly allowance. Upon reviewing her invoices, Jimmy's suspicions grow and he begins collecting invoices from other residents. Jimmy and Chuck analyze them and find evidence of Sandpiper systematically overcharging residents, making the company guilty of fraud. Chuck suggests there are grounds for a class action lawsuit and encourages Jimmy to continue investigating.\nJimmy is stopped at Sandpiper Crossing's front desk, preventing him from seeing clients. He hears papers being shredded and goes to a bathroom to hastily write on toilet paper a demand letter for Sandpiper to stop destroying evidence. He hands the letter to a manager as he is escorted out. \nThat night, Jimmy looks through the retirement home's dumpsters for shredded papers. Chuck and Jimmy sort through the shreds and piece together an incriminating document. Chuck decides to become Jimmy's co-counsel, and Sandpiper's attorneys agree to a meeting.\nMike Ehrmantraut babysits Kaylee. When Stacey returns from work, she asks Mike what to do with the money from her suitcase.[a] Mike says she should use it to do something good for herself and her daughter. Stacey says that even if she does, she will not have enough to cover living expenses. Mike returns to Dr. Caldera to follow up on Caldera's previous offer of illegal work.[b]\nSandpiper's attorneys deny the company is defrauding residents, but concede some were overcharged. The company offers $100,000 in compensation, but Jimmy presents evidence that Sandpiper's fraud makes them eligible for a RICO case. Chuck demands Sandpiper pay $20 million to settle, which their attorneys refuse. As Chuck and Jimmy continue to prepare their case, a preoccupied Chuck casually leaves his house to retrieve documents from Jimmy's car, taking none of his usual EHS precautions. Jimmy is speechless as he watches from inside the front door, then softly calls Chuck's name. Chuck is stunned to realize where he is and drops the papers.\n\nProduction[edit]\nThis was the second episode written by Gordon Smith and directed by Colin Bucksey, respectively.\n\nReception[edit]\nUpon airing, the episode received 2.87 million American viewers, and an 18-49 rating of 1.3.[1]\nThe episode received a generally positive reception from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, based on 23 reviews, it received a 96% approval rating with an average score of 7.97 out of 10. The site's consensus reads, \"\"RICO\" introduces an intriguing fraud case while providing insightful backstory to Jimmy's unlikely beginnings as a lawyer.\"[2] Roth Cornet of IGN gave the episode an 8.8 rating, concluding, \"With \u201cRICO\u201d, Better Call Saul lays the foundation for the circumstances that will likely transform sweet(ish) Jimmy McGill into the hardened Saul Goodman.\"[3] The Telegraph rated the episode 4 out of 5 stars.[4]\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ During \"Five-O\".\n\n^ During \"Five-O\".\n\n\nReferences[edit]", "start_char_idx": 1898, "end_char_idx": 5776, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe8272a6-3f17-4fef-a758-b633743a2495": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe8272a6-3f17-4fef-a758-b633743a2495", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RICO_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3dcdb24b-e10e-46bf-841e-8bd0f2485bc1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RICO_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "hash": "129a1f71231635fc1bbc0549f68d8b2e576c6081fd6c4e21ecefb308766c02a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2cee4e22-860c-4e87-8886-34e53df1ab28", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RICO_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "hash": "1cfeeda7e4f934e979d1efe20e897fe86616021b54b8c12717a0b97e01dd6253", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "42ea550c-5222-4f94-82dd-f7b3badb540e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e96b2af0eea484cc0950d96570a4e580a02c061191bcbb8d1df404869c4e8eac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "ff7cf39dc1d8adb2d608dcc215c5569800ad5eefde448553d6101a07092388c9", "text": "^ During \"Five-O\".\n\n^ During \"Five-O\".\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Kondolojy, Amanda (March 24, 2015). \"Monday Cable Ratings: 'Monday Night RAW' Tops Night + 'Love & Hop-Hop', 'Better Call Saul', 'Teen Mom' & More\".

The episode aired on March 30, 2015 on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nJimmy McGill and Chuck McGill sit on a bench outside Chuck's house. Jimmy encourages Chuck to enjoy relaxing outside, while Chuck's EHS causes him to warily eye a nearby electrical transformer. Chuck warns Jimmy that Sandpiper's attorneys will attempt to obtain a restraining order barring Jimmy from their property, which Jimmy prevents from being approved. Upon returning to Chuck's house, he finds that Sandpiper's attorneys have resorted to a document dump. Chuck suggests referring the case to HHM. Jimmy is reluctant but arranges a meeting. While Jimmy is asleep, Chuck uses Jimmy's phone to make a call.\nThe next morning, Howard Hamlin prepares for Chuck and Jimmy's arrival at HHM by confiscating cell phones and shutting off the electricity. Howard offers Jimmy twenty percent of the final settlement or judgment and a $20,000 of counsel fee but makes clear that Jimmy will not continue working on the case. Jimmy angrily demands to know why he is always excluded from the firm. When Howard does not answer, Jimmy keeps the case. Kim Wexler confronts Howard, who resists telling her the reason for his actions, but then confides the truth.\nMike Ehrmantraut receives a job offer to bodyguard Daniel Wormald, who wants to sell pills stolen from his employer. Daniel considers Mike, Sobchak, and Man Mountain. Sobchak mocks Mike for carrying no weapons, only a pimento cheese sandwich for lunch. He dares Mike to disarm him, which Mike easily does, prompting Man Mountain to flee. Mike coaches Daniel on how to act during the drug deal. Nacho Varga hands over a large sum of cash. Daniel notes the payment is twenty dollars short and Mike calmly insists that Nacho pay in full. As they leave, Mike tells Daniel he had researched Nacho and knew the deal would be carried out without his bosses' knowledge, so Nacho would not risk a confrontation.\nKim suggests Jimmy take Howard's offer, which will enable him to start his own firm. After rejecting Kim's advice, Jimmy realizes Chuck used his phone the night before. The next day, Jimmy informs Chuck that he will accept Howard's deal. Having deduced that Chuck was using Howard to keep Jimmy out of HHM, Jimmy demands to know why Chuck has treated him so badly. Chuck says he does not consider Jimmy a real lawyer. He says he was proud when Jimmy stopped running cons and worked in the HHM mailroom, but Jimmy should not be an attorney because he has not changed his dishonest ways. Feeling betrayed, Jimmy cuts his ties with Chuck.\n\nProduction[edit]\nThis episode was written and directed by Thomas Schnauz, who also wrote \"Nacho\" earlier in the season.\nSteven Ogg's character is named Sobchak in the script for the show, but never referred to by name, and later only named as the alias \"Mr. X\" in the fifth-season episode \"Dedicado a Max\". The name was selected by Schnauz in reference to John Goodman's character Walter Sobchak in The Big Lebowski.[1]\nA flashback scene was filmed for this episode featuring a young Jimmy McGill witnessing his father getting scammed at by a grifter, but was dropped for time constraints.[2] However, the staff chose not to release the scene as a bonus feature for the first season home video release out of hopes of using it further down the line; the scene would eventually be used for the second season episode \"Inflatable\".[3]\n\nReception[edit]\nBob Odenkirk (left) and Michael McKean (right) both received high praise for their performances in the episode\nUpon airing, the episode received 2.38 million American viewers, and an 18\u201349 rating of 1.1.[4]\nThe episode received critical acclaim, with many critics praising the plot twist at the end and the performances from Bob Odenkirk and Michael McKean. On Rotten Tomatoes, based on 20 reviews, it received a 100% approval rating with an average score of 8.8 out of 10. The site's consensus reads, \"A terrifically-acted, heart-wrenching revelation, mixed with a tough and powerful subplot for Mike, makes \"Pimento\" a superior penultimate episode of a consistently strong season.\"[5] Roth Cornet of IGN gave the episode a 9.0 rating, concluding, \"Better Call Saul revealed the betrayal that may very well be at the heart of what turns Jimmy McGill into Saul Goodman, as this stunningly crafted story continues to unfold.\"[6] The Telegraph rated the episode 4 out of 5 stars.[7] Odenkirk submitted this episode when nominated for the Emmy for Best Actor.[citation needed]\n\nReferences[edit]", "start_char_idx": 1813, "end_char_idx": 6650, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f224727-f851-4689-9f3f-7082b5dfccb0": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f224727-f851-4689-9f3f-7082b5dfccb0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimento_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "542f5bf4-5427-4853-a06d-a1824b65d1f1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimento_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "hash": "d64606c54c92945e111b79c65b79d8fd6436aea7f0761e715d285706454b7c2b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "131279dc-998b-40dc-aead-14aaf642af94", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimento_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "hash": "79465ab0aab14f7599fcc68e56bed1df1a6ba8f32457145f19e28e4ca1c55caa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ba6c1949-5729-49e2-bf5f-18ba1cd1ad10", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3752a354f10dbf2893ea3206da9878758fe339d1962658ae3671d03af3bae730", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "2aec63d46b911b673fa2705f8e612aa2b84ac1b27a9a1e6bc1c4ed64a7586199", "text": "^ Sepinwall, Alan (March 16, 2020). \"'Better Call Saul' Recap: Go Your Own Way\".

Written and directed by series co-creator Peter Gould, \"Marco\" aired on AMC in the United States on April 6, 2015. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries.\n\n\nPlot[edit]\nOpening[edit]\nIn a flashback to 1992, Jimmy McGill has been released from jail[a] with Chuck McGill's help. Jimmy agrees to Chuck's demand that he move to Albuquerque to live an honest life. Before leaving Cicero, Illinois, he goes to a favorite bar to say goodbye to Marco Pasternak, his partner in crime.\n\nMain story[edit]\nJimmy gives the Sandpiper case to HHM[b] and reveals he figured out Chuck was sabotaging his career. Howard Hamlin apologizes for his involvement and gives Jimmy his $20,000 counsel fee. Jimmy requests that Howard take over caring for Chuck.\nJimmy calls bingo at the local senior center. After an improbable string of numbers beginning with \"B\", he fixates on words beginning with that letter which remind him of Chuck. Jimmy rants about taking revenge in Illinois against someone named Chet by defecating through the sunroof of Chet's car (the \"Chicago Sunroof\") without realizing Chet's children were in the back seat. Facing the possibility of registering as a sex offender if convicted, Jimmy asked Chuck for help. Chuck got the charges dropped but Jimmy blames this event for their feud.\nJimmy returns to Cicero and reunites with Marco. After running a scam on an unsuspecting businessman, they spend several days running cons. At the end of the week, Jimmy explains he is an attorney and must return to Albuquerque to see to his clients. Marco convinces Jimmy to stay for one last con. While running the scam, Marco suffers a heart attack and dies. Jimmy inherits Marco's pinky ring, which he begins to wear even though it is too big.", "start_char_idx": 4, "end_char_idx": 4079, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5858a134-843c-45f5-8fe2-8a7e17d702d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "5858a134-843c-45f5-8fe2-8a7e17d702d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a2d144b4-efd5-43a7-87df-d4c4063f5946", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "hash": "187276225de6ef3985db5395ee6d50fa0a90f8a684d6f18a09183b766a1f88ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "63ed5130-dcdb-41ac-ada3-021d856a4204", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"URL": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_(Better_Call_Saul)"}, "hash": "a86bbc3add9c600859ae9af85a17ae380224470020be37afc58ef59e320bf83a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "feb17691-427b-472f-b998-1c0ff67eb4b7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6aecdf1b65cbc96529abfd4df794731924b81891946900e5d4689c9ac459dc5d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "8451d7348d5a62889d7cbed1f59cf184ed315d215b702f2f5547e984ec2d6e19", "text": "Jimmy rants about taking revenge in Illinois against someone named Chet by defecating through the sunroof of Chet's car (the \"Chicago Sunroof\") without realizing Chet's children were in the back seat.

While running the scam, Marco suffers a heart attack and dies. Jimmy inherits Marco's pinky ring, which he begins to wear even though it is too big.\nKim Wexler calls Jimmy to report the Sandpiper case has grown too big for HHM, requiring them to partner with Davis & Main. Because of Jimmy's rapport with the clients, D&M is interested in hiring him. Jimmy arranges to meet the D&M partners at the courthouse but changes his mind and drives away. He stops to ask Mike why they did not keep the money they took from the Kettlemans.[c] Mike Ehrmantraut recalls Jimmy did not take it because he wanted to do the \"right thing\" and says he did not because Jimmy hired him to do a job and he did it. Jimmy assures Mike he will not make the same mistake again and drives off while humming \"Smoke on the Water\", the song Marco was humming just before he died.\n\nProduction[edit]\nThis episode was written and directed by series co-creator Peter Gould, who also wrote \"Uno\" and \"Mijo\" earlier this season.\nAccording to Gould, all the scams depicted in the episode are based on real-life cases.[1]\nThe fictitious Equatorial Uqbar Orbis that Jimmy mentions during a scam is a reference to the Jorge Luis Borges story Tl\u00f6n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius.\nDuring the montage of scams, Marco speaks the line, \"Hey, kid, help me get my wife's car out of this bad neighborhood.\"\nIn the episode, a woman who had sex with Jimmy after he tricked her into thinking he was Kevin Costner realizes he is not. This is a reference to the Breaking Bad episode \"Abiquiu\", where Saul (Jimmy) tells Walter White, \"I once told a woman I was Kevin Costner, and it worked because I believed it.\"[2]\n\nReception[edit]\nRatings[edit]\nUpon airing, the episode received 2.53 million American viewers, and an 18-49 rating of 1.2;[3] including Live+7 ratings, the finale was watched by 5.76 million viewers, and had a 2.8 18-49 rating overall.[4]\n\nCritical response[edit]\nThe episode received a highly positive reception from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, based on 27 reviews, it received an 89% approval rating with an average score of 8.55 out of 10. The site's consensus reads, \"The investment into Better Call Saul's first season pays off with a finale that is at once comic and tragic, as Jimmy's conversion to Saul nears completion.\"[5]\nRoth Cornet of IGN gave the episode a 9.0 rating, concluding, \"Better Call Saul gave us an exemplary first season of television. The finale brought us to the moment where Jimmy made the decision to abandon his attempt to walk a righteous path and, instead, give over to his baser drives and desires. A more open-ended conclusion may have felt more emotionally impactful. On the whole, though, this was a gorgeously designed and executed episode; one that leaves enough room for \u2013 what we hope will be \u2013 an equally extraordinary second season.\"[6] The Telegraph rated the episode 4 out of 5 stars.[7]\n\nAccolades[edit]\nAt the 67th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, Kelley Dixon and Chris McCaleb were nominated for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series for their work on this episode, while Phillip W. Palmer, Larry Benjamin, and Kevin Valentine were nominated for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series. The episode and its sound mixers, Phillip W. Palmer, Larry B.
